## Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Asprice Makeup showed steady growth earlier in the year, but recent sales dropped sharply by up to 83%. The analysis indicates that the absence of a loyalty program, weak marketing focus, limited promotions, and lack of wholesale channels contributed to this decline.

Key insights include:

- A **20–80 pattern** where a small number of brands, products, and customers generate most revenue.
- The top ten products account for **35% of total sales**, showing heavy dependency on a limited product catalog.
- The top three brands alone contribute over **60% of all sales**.
- One single product generates almost **10% of total revenue**, indicating significant reliance on a few key products.

Based on these findings, Asprice Makeup would benefit from:

- Implementing a loyalty program
- Focusing marketing efforts on high-performing products
- Introducing targeted promotions
- Expanding wholesale distribution
